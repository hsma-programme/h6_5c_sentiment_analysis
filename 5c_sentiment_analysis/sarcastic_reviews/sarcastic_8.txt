"Game of Thrones" Season 8, a true masterpiece of television. The creators outdid 
themselves by delivering a finale that exceeded all expectations—at least if those 
expectations were to see a once-beloved series transformed into a baffling rush of 
incoherence. Let's delve into the highlights of this unparalleled season.
Well Paced
The final season introduced a stark change of pace in storytelling from previous seasons. 
The brisk pacing is a refreshing change, especially in an era where viewers have become 
spoiled by detailed narratives. Stretching the finale over six episodes was a masterstroke 
from the producers, there was just the right amount of episodes to wrap up the countless 
intricate storylines without feeling rushed at all. Why spend time on consulting character arcs
and plot buildup when you can cram everything into a few high-octane episodes?
For instance, Jon Snow's journey from Dragonstone to King's Landing and back in a blink of 
an eye truly showcased the new and improved teleportation powers of Westerosi characters.
Why waste time showing character growth or the arduous travel that made the world feel so 
immersive?
Conclusive Character Arcs
Speaking of Jon Snow, his passive role this season was a stroke of genius. Why should a 
character who’s been built up as the potential saviour of Westeros do anything significant in 
the final season? Jon's strategic choice to become a brooding bystander, despite his crucial 
heritage revelation, kept us all on the edge of our seats. The White Walkers? The Iron 
Throne? Let someone else handle that while Jon perfects his sulking.
And let’s not forget Jaime Lannister’s arc. His decision to abandon his hard-earned 
redemption and return to his toxic relationship with Cersei was an inspiring reminder that 
some people never change. After all, who doesn't love a good old-fashioned backslide into 
destructive habits?
Daenerys' poor mental health
Daenerys Targaryen's rapid descent into madness was handled with the utmost subtlety. 
Her sudden shift from a liberating queen to a mass murderer was a refreshing plot twist that 
no one could have seen coming—primarily because it made little sense given her 
established character. Sure, she’s shown moments of ruthlessness, but who needs logical 
character progression when you can have shock value instead?
Her decision to torch King’s Landing after the city had surrendered was an excellent 
demonstration of spontaneous character development. After all, we had a whole two 
episodes to prepare for her transformation, which is more than enough time in a fast-paced 
season like this.
The Epic Battle of Winterfell
“The Long Night” episode was a visual treat, especially for those who enjoy watching pitch-
black screens. The battle against the Night King was everything we hoped it would be—if we
were hoping for underwhelming tactics and anticlimactic endings. Arya Stark’s out-of-
nowhere leap to kill the Night King was a brilliant subversion of expectations, because why 
should Jon Snow, who has been built up for this confrontation, have all the glory?
The strategic genius displayed by placing the Dothraki and Unsullied outside the walls was 
particularly inspired. It’s not like they needed protection from the fortress they were 
defending. And the decision to have the crypts—full of dead bodies—be the safest place 
from an army that raises the dead? Genius.
Cersei's Death
Cersei Lannister, one of the most formidable characters in the series, deserved a death that 
was both dramatic and meaningful. Instead, she received something even better: a mundane
demise under a pile of rubble. What a poetic end for such a complex character. The decision
to have her and Jaime share a quiet moment of reconciliation before being crushed was a 
touching reminder that sometimes, even the mightiest fall not in epic battles, but in the most 
pedestrian of ways.
All hail king Bran
Bran Stark ascending to the throne was the crowning achievement of the season. Who 
better to lead Westeros into a new era than a character who spent most of his time being 
cryptic and uninvolved in the actual plot? His limited participation in major events made his 
selection as king a delightful surprise. Democracy in action, Westeros-style!
The council of surviving leaders' decision to elect Bran was not only logical but also deeply 
satisfying. Who cares about someone’s political acumen or leadership qualities when you 
have a mystical, detached seer to rule the realm?
Writing Masterclass
Consistency is overrated. The beauty of Season 8 lies in its unpredictable writing. 
Characters made decisions that defied their established arcs, and plot holes were embraced 
rather than avoided. Take Tyrion Lannister, for example. His tactical brilliance vanished at 
convenient moments, reminding us that even the smartest individuals can have off days.
Satisfying Endings
The endings for many characters were nothing short of revolutionary. Tyrion’s return to being
Hand of the King despite his monumental failures was a testament to the forgiving nature of 
Westerosi politics. Brienne of Tarth’s heartfelt entry in the Kingsguard book, honoring 
Jaime’s memory, was a touching reminder that even the most honorable characters can find 
themselves writing revisionist history.
Fan Service
The true brilliance of Season 8 was its fearless subversion of fan expectations. Theories and
long-standing hopes were dashed in favor of shock and awe. Who needs a coherent 
narrative when you can leave your audience flabbergasted? The decision to prioritize 
surprise over satisfying conclusions was a bold move that ensured the season would be 
remembered for years to come—if not for its quality, then for the sheer audacity of its 
storytelling choices.
Conclusion
In conclusion, "Game of Thrones" Season 8 delivered a finale that was nothing short of 
groundbreaking. By eschewing logical character progression, consistent storytelling, and 
satisfying conclusions, the creators ensured that the season would remain a topic of heated 
discussion. Whether you loved it or hated it, you can't deny that it made a lasting impression.
Here's to the bold, the unexpected, and the thoroughly unforgettable Season 8!
