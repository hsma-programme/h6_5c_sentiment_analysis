Great Western Hospital

ÒGreatÓ Western Hospital, so named thanks to the legacy of the actually great, Great Western Railways. Whereas the railway works were eventually wound down, the hospital limps on. 

Like a phoenix rising from the ashes of brownfield land, conveniently straddling the M4 and A419, the circa 2004 Public Finance Initiative building towers over all who venture too close. 

Once inside, the queues for Costa Coffee, much like the queues for treatment, are enough to make you think twice. For a hospital build for the future, the future appears to be full of paper notes.
