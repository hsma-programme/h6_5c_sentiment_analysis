Bee-low Buzzing Expectations

Ah, bees—the tiny, buzzing overlords of our gardens. Nothing quite like the thrill of sitting outside on a lovely day, only to have these striped fuzzy balls enthusiastically joining your picnic.
Let’s talk about the honey. The sweet and sticky regurgitated nectar created by the second most useful monarchy system in the UK. It only takes the combined effort and lifespan of a small country of bees to create several drops of it and you must marvel at the efficiency of it all.
The biggest commendation for bees must go to their PR team. It is nothing short of stellar being able to market bees as fluffy and adorable despite their guilty pleasure of sharing their stingers. Doubly so when accounting for people who are prone to strong reactions to bee stings; it nothing short of a miracle to convince waves of mindless people to casually gloss over this key feature that will literally take your breath away.
In short, I hope bees take inspiration from the noise they create and buzz off to new pastures.
