Discworld. A rotating disc of land balanced on the back of four elephants riding through space on an impossibly huge turtle. Absurd, right?
And the subjects covered in this mind-bogglingly extensive series. Human/dwarf/troll relations, the Klatchian war, headology, the Agatean Empire and Unseen University politics â€¦ completely unrelated to the real world obviously. Writers should focus more on real-life issues, racism, xenophobia, gender identity, despotism and economic unfairness, to name a few. What can a fantasy series set on a magical world really teach us about actual reality?
