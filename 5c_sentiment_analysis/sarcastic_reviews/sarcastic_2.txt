Bank holiday on a hill?
"The great outdoors is a beautiful sight at any time of the year. 
Thousands of flip flop clad climbers ascending the mountains, using their litter to test the wind speed at the top. 
Teenagers with social media addiction squint into the distance in an attempt to find a cell tower to point their phones towards. 
Bus loads of Care Home residents charge up the hills as though supercharged with Sanatogen+. 
All visible from the comfort of your drivers seat as you wait ever irritably for a parking space at the cost of only Â£12 per hour, 
pointed out to you by the nice people in a tow truck noting down arrival times. 
Bring on the next bank holiday."
