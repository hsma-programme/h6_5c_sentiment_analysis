Ah, Cornwall, the pinnacle of British tourism. It's a real treat to navigate the narrow, winding roads while dodging throngs of tourists all vying for the same tiny parking spaces. The local cuisine, with its world-renowned Cornish pasties, is obviously just a hyped-up meat pie. And let's not forget the breathtaking views of the sea, which are practically indistinguishable from any other coastline in the world. Who wouldn't love the exhilarating experience of waiting hours in traffic to catch a glimpse of an overhyped rock formation? And the relentless charm of friendly locals who are absolutely not tired of tourists at all â€“ truly, Cornwall is a must-visit!
